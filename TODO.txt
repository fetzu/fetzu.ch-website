# fetzu dot ch v2021.10 | TODO

Code:
[X] Find an elegant solution to obfuscate e-mail on "about" page. (Did not find an elegant soltuion, I'll stay with the "half obfuscated" solution for now.) -> Look into https://github.com/binarykitchen/munge.
[X] Make "home" the first link on the footer (or not at all).
[X] Look into changing the background color (maybe). ($fetzu-bg in /themes/sam/assets/sass/_vars.sass)
[X] Look if possible to integrate the "console" site in the same deployment, or at least to make "/console" take us there. (to test, solved with Netlify _redirect file)
[X] Make footer year (currently (c)) dynamic.

Write:
[X] Write a better "about" page (maybe?). -> Not needed for now, added links to portfolio and console in case it wasn't obvious.
[ ] Write a (half-)good first/introduction post.
[X] Look into the footer: (c) v. another kind of licence? -> Leaving the Â© for now. Might look at how to open-source later (separate content and site)

Content:
[X] Find a cool video and/or picture for the background on home page.
[X] Select samples of work to put into portfolio (photos, video-embeds, writing samples/Rankr, code samples, ...).
[X] Integrate all the selected work into the portfolio.
[X] Create favicon and incorporate it.
[ ] Make image for Open Graph (see config.toml)?
